This course will provide an overview of electronic trading, with primary focus on short-term limit order book dynamics. We will overview the practical reality of the equities market, study the literature on a select set of topics that play an important role on short-term market dynamics and execution quality, and get the opportunity to interact with a rich set of market data. In the press, many of these topics are lumped up under the term \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153High-Frequency Trading (HFT),\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d and I will try, on the margin, to offer a reasonable and nuanced overview of the area from the broker / HFT / traditional buy-side / regulator viewpoints.The topics that we will cover:- algorithmic trading:+ high-level overview; popular execution strategies; trading technology overview+ market data inputs to algorithmic strategies: trading volume; volatility; spreads; depth; market impact models+ review literature on optimal execution: different modeling frameworks; key findings; what happens in practice- limit order book:+ overview+ point process view+ queueing model of LOB+ four illustrative problems: a) estimating time until an order fills; b) optimal execution in LOB and market impact modeling; c) order routing in fragmented markets; d) adverse selection- data:+ trades and quotes (TAQ) data for US equities with millisecond timestamps going back 4-5 years; starting July 27 the timestamps have microsecond timestamps+ sample of proprietary trade data 2012-2014 (not current)+ a software development environment that allows to query and analyze that data (\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Onetick\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d) and one to design strategies and backtest them against TAQ data (the latter, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Lime\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Strategy Studio,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d requires coding in C++\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 ouch!)+ database of reference data, e.g., 1 min summaries of US equity activity during 2013-15Course organization & goals:This course will be an advanced MBA / PhD course. I am aiming for a 50/50 mix inside the class.A significant part of the course will be on modeling and academic research in the above area; this will leverage and expand on a set of lectures I prepared and gave last spring in London. Another part of the course will review practice and give access to data for students to explore. The methodological content will likely be heavy when compared to quantitative MBA courses (i.e., they will be well beyond the level of our quant core courses) \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c I am sharing this as an important disclaimer. The ideas, however, are very useful, they will be accessible, practical and interesting. So, despite the fact that part of the course will be focusing on cutting-edge methodological research in the area, MBA students should learn a ton about electronic trading, market microstructure, and get exposure on empirical analysis of the very rich data that will be made available.For PhD students, the course will offer an overview of a very interesting and dynamic area, focusing on the mathematical modeling of limit order book markets, and, as explained above, also give broad access to rich data to get a closer view of the short-term behavior of these HFT markets.I had the opportunity to build and direct a team that designed, built and operated such a trading system for about 5-6 years, and fortunately (or unfortunately) had to grapple with all types of problems, from the most interesting and mathematically challenging, to the most mundane (but necessary). And hopefully some of that will also be exposed in the course.\\u00c2\\u00a0\\n\",\n          \"&nbsp;\\nPersonal Leadership &amp; Success   Leadership is frequently thought of in terms of our ability to understand and direct our external environment &mdash; people, organizations and events. &nbsp;Personal Leadership and Success (PLS) takes the view that to succeed in professional life we need to develop another dimension of leadership consisting of our ability to understand and direct our internal environment &mdash; our mindsets, emotions and motivations. &nbsp;Some of the most crucial skills in life have to do with how well we can manage this internal environment under ever-changing external circumstances. &nbsp;How quickly can we rebound from setbacks to execute our roles with renewed enthusiasm? &nbsp;How well are our day-to-day priorities and activities aligned with our core values and goals? &nbsp;Can we stay calm and focused in the face of intense work pressure? &nbsp;How effective are we at eliminating feelings of anger or anxiety that grip us from time to time? &nbsp;How can we cultivate a winner&rsquo;s mindset that will allow us to perform at our optimum all the time? &nbsp;What does it take to successfully execute a &ldquo;change program&rdquo; in our lives?  PLS integrates three sources of insight &ndash; (a) Recent Scientific Advances (from psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive behavior therapy), (b) Inner Lives of Great Achievers (such as Lincoln, Gandhi, Mandela, Churchill, Martin Luther King, Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan) &nbsp;and (c) Personal Reflections &ndash; to provide you an understanding of the following questions: \\n\\nWhat impact does your internal environment have on your      success? \\nWhat Personal Leadership skills are needed to achieve      mastery over your internal environment? &nbsp;What is your current level      of competency in these areas? \\nWhat techniques can you utilize to develop these skills      further? \\n\\n PLS is a catalyst for self-reflection and for getting students to make specific changes in behavior and thought patterns that will yield tangible improvements in their mastery over their inner environment. &nbsp;Lectures are supplemented by exercises involving introspection, self-evaluation, and the application of specific Personal Leadership techniques by students in their own lives. &nbsp;  Note: &nbsp;Enrollment is limited to 52 students. &nbsp;This class will take place on four full-day Friday sessions + a Fri-Sun offsite retreat. &nbsp;The four Fridays are: &nbsp;Jan 23, Feb 6, Mar 20 and Apr 17 &mdash; 9 am&ndash;5:30 pm. &nbsp;&nbsp;All students are required to attend the offsite retreat (12 noon Fri Apr 3 &ndash; 3 pm Sun Apr 5). &nbsp;The school is subsidizing the retreat, but net of the school&rsquo;s subsidy, each student will need to pay $400 for the 2-day offsite. \\n\",\n          \"Over the past few decades, wealth in the United States and around the world has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of families. These families have steadily expanded their holdings, often starting with an operating business created by an entrepreneur and evolving into entities including trusts, holding companies, investment partnerships, family offices, and charitable foundations.   Given this trend, it is almost inevitable that all MBA students will own, work for, invest in, or otherwise interact with family enterprises in their personal and professional lives.  This six-week course will help students gain a nuanced understanding of family enterprises by exploring how they operate, how to understand and navigate their complexity, and how to think strategically about them.\\nThe course will proceed from the perspective of family first and work through a timely case study that touches upon the key issues covered in class.  Particular emphasis will be given the fact that the most important resource that fosters a successful family enterprise is its own &ldquo;human capital,&rdquo; namely, its family members. The ways and means of developing this resource, to enhance overall family wealth and to optimize the family&rsquo;s important role in society, will be carefully explored.  Technical issues, including legal concepts and structures that are specific to family enterprises, will also be examined.  Guest lecturers will join the class to provide real-life context to the class discussion.\\nStudents will leave the course prepared to more effectively own, manage, and interact with family enterprises, which will have a direct impact on their potential for future success, both personally and professionally.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

But most of your personal experience and MBA training is biased towards B2C (\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Business to Consumer\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d). This course is designed to fill this gap. As a consumer, you are an experienced and active participant in B2C (\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Business to Consumer), being the target of marketing campaigns. Even when not actively in \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153shopping-mode,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d you are constantly exposed to B2C marketing activities, as you watch television or use the internet. If you have already taken marketing courses, your personal insight into B2C enables you to understand how companies compete through powerful strategic concepts, like market segmentation, product positioning, and marketing mix. The situation may be quite different for the B2B context-and here are some of the reasons: (1) you have been less exposed to the B2B sector. (2) targeting a business is quite different than targeting a consumer-so while the strategic marketing concepts are universal, their application also a different challenge. (3) in B2C your learning from one product space is generally \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153portable\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d. In B2B, your experience in one product space is more difficult to generalize, because of differences in market structures. Yet we must use analytical concepts and models there for strategic decisions. (4) the nature of the B2C market allows industries and academics to perform research and make decisions based hard data. In B2B data is frequently difficult to collect or the number of customers is simply too small, rendering statistics not credible. That means that personal experience and learning from others is crucial for success. \",\n          \"This course has two general objectives. First, to learn about how motivation works from recent conceptual and empirical advances in psychological science. Second, to have students use this knowledge to make motivation work for them\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201din their own performance, but, especially, as motivators of others. Motivation science has exploded in the last 20 years. Despite this explosion, most people still believe that the best way to motivate others is by using \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153carrots and sticks\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d (incentives), which is based on the classic assumption that what motivates people is to approach pleasure and avoid pain (the hedonic principle). What we have learned is that motivation is more than \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153carrots and sticks\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d, and that, importantly, there are many different kinds of motivational mechanisms that underlie people\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s choices and what influences them. The class sessions in the course will be informed by a combination of class lectures and discussions, readings, case studies, in-class exercises, and student presentations on their own group projects. There is one thing that all Chief Executives agree on\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dwhether their organization is business, military, sports, academia\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthere is nothing more important to being successful in their job than to be successful in motivating others. But how can you make motivation work? For the answer, you first need to know how motivation itself works. This course is designed for the students to learn both how motivation works and how they can use it to work for them. The motivational mechanisms and principles that will be covered in the readings and discussed in class, as well as how these mechanisms and principles can be used to be a more effective motivator in business-relevant settings, are summarized below when describing each class. \",\n          \"Most major companies are not single businesses firms operating in a single location but portfolios of products and business units spanning multiple locations. This course studies corporate strategy in terms of portfolio composition and organization, focusing in particular on vertical integration, horizontal scope, and geographic diversification decisions. Class time shall be devoted to discussing cases to gain a better understanding of the economic factors underlying value creation and value capture in corporate strategy. In particular, we will explore the role of transaction costs, agency costs, complementarities, and organizational rigidity and adaptation. Students who take this course will develop a sophisticated basis for analyzing corporate strategy decisions both as insiders (corporate managers and management consultants), and as analysts and
