# CBS Projects

This repository brings together three connected projects exploring **PRofessors' evaluations**, **student club enrollment**,**student elective course choices for LDA** at Columbia Business School (CBS). The overarching goal is to understand patterns in how students pick courses, and whether we can group them into **interest clusters** (e.g., Finance, Entrepreneurship, Analytics) without manually defining categories. Also built a dashboard on Tableau for **Peer School Comparisons** from 2019-2024. 

The repo is divided into three main components:

1. **Clean Historical Evaluation Data**
2. **Clean Historical Club Data**
3. **Update Peer School Comparison Charts**
4. **Student Clustering with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
